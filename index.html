            <p><justify>I'm a passionate developer with foundation in both mobile and web technologies. My expertise lies in Java and Kotlin for Android app development, backed by hands-on experience using Android Studio. On the web front, I specialize in building responsive and user-friendly interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In every project, I also leverage design tools like Figma to plan intuitive UI layouts and collaborate across creative and development workflows. Whether crafting mobile apps or interactive websites, I aim to build products that are not only technically sound but also visually impactful.</justify></p>

            <p><justify>Currently expanding my skills through practical projects, I thrive on solving real-world problems and transforming ideas into digital solutions that matter.</justify></p>
